# Dog-Training-Database
Dog training database project for Database Design Class

All the Final code for each webpage, the SQL Code that was used, and presentation are in the Dog Training folder (Not the Dog_Training_App folder). All the rest of the files were code that we used for ourselves to get code back and forth to each other so there is nothing important outside the Dog_Training folder. We used XAMPP to get code to connect to a web browser. Other than that there is nothing special to initialize system.
